# What is that?
A few lightweight classes to ease working with enums, with very small run-time performance impact.

# How to use
1. Run `composer require exsyst/mini-enum` in your project ;
2. Derive your enum classes containing standalone values from `EXSyst\MiniEnum\Enum` ;
3. Derive your enum classes containing bit masks from `EXSyst\MiniEnum\FlagsEnum`.
